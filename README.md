# Outcomes

Our proposed outcome for this project is to create an application whereby players of Final Fantasy 14 can interact with one another. They will have a user profile, which displays information about their account and other details. They can look up items and armour, which they can add to a 'favourites' list. These items and armour can be commented on, so players can add that they are looking for an item or piece of armour; other players can then reply saying that they know the location of the item or can help find them.
