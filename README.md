# Description

Eorzea is a Node and Express app utilising MongoDB in the backend, developed by Joao Sinfronio and Alex Hardiment. It uses the Final Fantasy XIV API to allow users to sign up and link their in-game character and to search for Final Fantasy XIV items. They can then share comments on description item pages and each others' profiles. The user can also save items to their profile to make other users aware of in-game items they are seeking. This app has full sign up and log in authentication and users must 'follow' each others' pages in order to comment.
